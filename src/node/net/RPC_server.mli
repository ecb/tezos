(** Typed RPC services: server implementation. *)

(** A handle on the server worker. *)
type server

(** Promise a running RPC server. To call an RPC at /p/a/t/h/ in the
    provided service, one must call the URI /call/p/a/t/h/. Calling
    /list/p/a/t/h/ will list the services prefixed by /p/a/t/h/, if
    any. Calling /schema/p/a/t/h/ will describe the input and output
    of the service, if it is callable. Calling /pipe will read a
    sequence of services to call in sequence from the request body,
    see {!pipe_encoding}.

    The arguments cors_allowed_origins and cors_allowed_headers define
    the cross-origin resource sharing using the headers
    Access-Control-Allow-Origin and Access-Control-Allow-Headers. The
    argument cors_allowed_headers sets the content of
    Access-Control-Allow-Headers. Since you cannot have multiple
    values for Access-Control-Allow-Origin, the server accepts a list
    in cors_allowed_origins and matches it against the origin of the
    incoming request; then returns the longest element of the passed
    list as the content of Access-Control-Allow-Origin.

    The optional [pre_hook] is called with the path part of the URL
    before resolving each request, to delegate the answering to
    another resolution mechanism. Its result is ignored if the return
    code is [404]. The optional [post_hook] is called if both the
    [pre_hook] and the serviced answered with a [404] code. *)
